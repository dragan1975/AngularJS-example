# AngularJS-example
This is a project I have done by using Angular1. 
I have used an HTML template and devlopeted it into 
a small, functional web app. 
In js folder, there is ita.js file which is the heart of the project with routing 
system and controllers.
The file (ita.js) is highly commented (hope you dont mind that it is not in English) which was a part of the task
i had to accomplished for my studies in order to demonstrate my understanding of basic Angular functionalities. 
I have implemented a custom filter too for searching the products- the app supporting functionality. 
I have used PHP as the server side languge (serverska_logika folder) to deliver JSON format data for the app.
